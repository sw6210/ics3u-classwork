---------
Create a while loop that will print:
    1. from 375 to 597 by 6.
    2. from 392 to 405 by 1.
    3. from 297 to 619 by 7.
    4. from 310 to 838 by 11.
    5. from 427 to 583 by 12.
    6. from 452 to 548 by 4.
    7. from 298 to 788 by 10.
    8. from -448 to -160 by 8.
    9. from -53 to 633 by 14.
    10. from 471 to 539 by 2.

1. 
i = 375
while i <= 597:
    print(i)
    i += 6
    
2. 
i = 392
while i <= 405:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    
3. 
i = 297
while i <= 619:
    print(i)
    i += 7
    
4.
i = 310
while i <= 838:
    print(i)
    i += 11
    
5. 
i = 427
while i <= 583:
    print(i)
    i += 12
    
6. 
i = 452
while i <= 548:
    print(i)
    i += 4
    
7. 
i = 298
while i <= 788:
    print(i)
    i += 10
    
8. 
i = -448
while i <= -160:
    print(i)
    i += 8
    
9. 
i = -53
while i <= 633:
    print(i)
    i += 14
    
10. 
i = 471
while i <= 539:
    print(i)
    i += 2
